3.	Ask Display the following menu to the user:

[1] Addition
[2] Subtraction
Enter 1 or 2:

If they enter a 1, it should call the showAddition function (user-defined function) 
that will generate two random numbers between 5 and 20, and ask the user to add 
them together. Work out the correct answer and return both the user's answer 
and the correct answer using tuple.

If they entered 2 as their selection on the menu, it should call the 
showSubstraction (user-defined function) that will generate one number 
between 25 and 50 and another number between 1 and 25 and 
ask them to work out num1 minus num2. This way they will not have to 
worry about negative answers. Return both the user's answer and the 
correct answer using tuple.

Create another function call evaluation (user-defined function) that 
will check if the user's answer matches the actual answer. If it does, 
display 'Correct', otherwise display a message that will say 
'Wrong, the answer is' and display the real answer.

If they do not select a relevant option on the first menu you should 
display a suitable error message.

Sample program output:

Scenario 1:

[2] Subtraction
Enter 1 or 2: 1
6 + 26 =32   
Correct!

Scenario 2:
[1] Addition
[2] Subtraction
Enter 1 or 2: 1
20 + 27 =67
Wrong! The answer is  47

Scenario 3:
[1] Addition
[2] Subtraction
Enter 1 or 2: 2
50 - 21 =29
Correct!

Scenario 4:

[1] Addition
[2] Subtraction
Enter 1 or 2: 8
Incorrect selection
